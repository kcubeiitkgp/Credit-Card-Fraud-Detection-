# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. By leveraging the PyCaret library, a powerful, low-code machine learning library in Python, we can efficiently compare, select, and tune models for our fraud detection task. This approach simplifies the process of model selection and tuning, making it accessible to both novice and experienced data scientists.
